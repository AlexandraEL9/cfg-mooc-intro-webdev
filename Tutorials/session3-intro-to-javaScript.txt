JS = the language of the web
v popular
datatpes, variables and functions
saved in a js file
connected to HTML and CSS files to add interactivity
very versatile

console.log()   function that prints out anything between () to the terminal

--------------------------------variables

have values/ data stored inside and passed around the connected

older versions use var  

modern js uses const and let
a name would be a const value but taday's date would be let
--- let can be changed but const cannot.


-----------------------------------data types

data types

--primative data types- strings, numbers, floats, booleans
--Reference data types- objects, arrays, functions

-strings- usually text- must be surrounded by single or double quotes

-numbers- no quotes

-boolean- true or false

-undefined- special value a variable can use if it hasn't been defined 

-null- store nothing- eg 

--operators
characters that represent a specific mathematical or logical action or process
eg
arithmetic operators
comparison operators
logical operators

--opperands
The quantity on which an operation is to be done
eg
data tpes like numbers and strings


----Arithmetic operators take numerical values as their opperands an return numerical value

+
-
*
**
/
%
++ increment
-- decrement



CONCATENATION--adding strings together

const name = "Shuri"
const greeting = "Hi" + name

INTERPOLATION
    determiningg a value that falls between existing values in a given data set
const name = "Shuri"



const name = "Alex";
const age = 28;

console.log("My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");

or

const name = "Alex";
const age = 28;

console.log(`My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`);


----FUNCTIONS
a block of organised, reusable code used to perform a single, related action eg- add two numbers together
- have () at the end

JS has built in functione eg math()

addTwo Numbers()          -this calls the function

--parts of a function
function name- descriptive name
parameters- the info being given to the function

function code (instructions)

function calculateArea(width, height) {
    console.log(width*height);
}
